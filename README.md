Data Visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. This section covers fundamental and advanced visualization techniques for uncovering data patterns, relationships, and distributions.

📁 Topics Covered:

*   Basic Visualization: Line plots, Matplotlib basics, saving plots.
*   Categorical Plots: Bar plots, count plots, category-wise comparisons.
*   Distribution Plots: Histograms, KDE plots, distribution analysis, box plots.
*   Matrix & Correlation Plots: Heatmaps, correlation matrices, feature relationship visualization.
*   Regression Plots: Regression analysis with Seaborn, scatter plots with trend lines.
*   Seaborn Visualization: High-level statistical plots, styling, advanced EDA.
*   Capstone Visualization Project: End-to-end project with real data, applying learned concepts.

🧰 Tools & Libraries: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook.
